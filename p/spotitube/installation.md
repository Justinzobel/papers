# Installation

Spotitube binaries and packages are hosted on GitHub, in project's [_Releases_ section](https://github.com/streambinder/spotitube/releases). It actually supports all the common platforms know, such as generic Linux/Unix systems and Windows.

For Solus-Project, RedHat-based, Debian-based distributions users, there's an installable package, while for the others Linux/Unix users a generic binary can be used. For Windows users, an _exe_ binary variant is there, too.

## Updating

Theoretically, Spotitube is taught to be self-updated if not running an updated version. Anyway, nothing forbids you to download and install latest package/binary over the old one.
