# Installation

Chopper is written using Python and has been thought to be free from every external plugin. So you won't need anything else but its source code to run it or the prebuilt binary file.

## Prebuilt binary

{% embed url="https://github.com/streambinder/chopper" %}

Head to Chopper releases page to fetch latest binary file.

## Run latest source code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/streambinder/chopper.git
python3 chopper/src/main.py -h
```
