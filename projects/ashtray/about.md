# About

## What is it

{% embed url="https://github.com/streambinder/ashtray" caption="" %}

**Ashtray** is a custom and private `eopkg` repository. `eopkg` is the packaging format conceived and adopted by [Solus-Project](https://getsol.us), a Linux desktop distribution built from scratch.

This private repository was born by the need of having a place where to put custom packages which were not included by default on official repository.

The most important component hosted on this repository is Pantheon Desktop, which is the Desktop Environment developed by the [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io) team and which hasn't been included on Solus-Project repository due to [legitimate reasons](https://discuss.getsol.us/d/1500-how-to-generate-custom-iso/12). This is the answer I got from one of the development team members as a reply to my _why won't Pantheon Desktop be officially supported?_:

> Because Pantheon, first-and-foremost, is designed **for** elementary OS. To such a degree that I had to patch Granite, their toolkit that everything of theirs uses, to not segfault when using DateTime APIs when it **assumed** you had their Pantheon schemas for time set. And working with them as a downstream would be miserable, they can't even merge a single one of my PRs in. Fixing an entire desktop and all their applications to work **as we expect** them to? That's a hard nope.
>
> Pantheon, like Cinnamon, XFCE, etc. will never be supported or provided by us.
